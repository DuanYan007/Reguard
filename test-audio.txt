This is a placeholder test file to simulate an audio file for testing purposes.
In a real scenario, this would be an actual audio file like test.mp3 or test.wav.

For audio testing, you would use:
- MP3 files (.mp3)
- WAV files (.wav)
- OGG files (.ogg)
- FLAC files (.flac)
- M4A files (.m4a)
- AAC files (.aac)

The AudioConverter will:
1. Extract metadata from audio files
2. Generate placeholder transcription content
3. Format the output as Markdown

To test with real audio files, replace this file with actual audio files.
